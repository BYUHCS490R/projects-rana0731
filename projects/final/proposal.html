        <h2>2. A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h2>
            <p>I chose to build a website about K-pop because it has become a worldwide cultural influence, blending music, dance, fashion, and powerful fan communities. I enjoy learning about different groups and how each one has its own concept and style. Creating this site allows me to explore the most popular K-pop artists, compare groups, and organize information that fans—or anyone curious about K-pop—can easily understand and enjoy.</p>
