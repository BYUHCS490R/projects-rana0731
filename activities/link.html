        <h1>Links</h1>
        <p>1. Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</p>
        <a href = "https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/57nelson?lang=eng">President Nelson "Confidence in the Presence of God"</a>
        <br/>
        
        <p>2. What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</p>
        <p>- Root is starting point, for example https://byuhcs490r.github.io/projects-rana0731 is my root. 
        And "activities/basic.html" activities is folder, basic.html is ending file which I will open.</p>
        <p>-Path is made by folder names together, ending with the file name. </p>
        <p>-Domain name what computer know connects path and root name</p>
        <br/>

        <p>3. What is a default document?</p>
        <p> Main html file, which is home page.</p>

        <p>4.Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</p>
        <p> Absolute - protocol/domain/path also this is full path/address when files are in different folder</p>
        <p> Relative - filename only also when both files are in same location, then use this relative link </p>
        <br/>

        
        <p>5. Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).</p>
        <a href = "basic.html"> Another engagement assignment</a>
        <br/>

        <p>6. List the 3 rules with relative links.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Inside same folder</dt>
                <dd>Just file name "example.html"</dd>
            <dt>Up and down folder</dt>
                <dd>Go up one folder, uses two dot. "../example.html" </dd>
                <dd>Down to other folder inside same folder, write that folder name. "folder2/example.html"</dd>
            <dt>Start over (doesn't work for us)
            </dt>
                <dd>Add / at the start. "/folder/example.html</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>7. Link to your last project.</p>
        <a href = "https://byuhcs490r.github.io/projects-rana0731/projects/profilePage.html">My latest project</a>
        <br/>

        <p>8. Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</p>
