    <h1> Anar Fuxiang </h1>
    <p>Since I was in kindergarten I started watch and listen kpop groups. At that time I really keen on watching <mark>"T-ARA"</mark>. On TV, loud speaker, following movements, dancing and singing, all <em>UNFORGETTABLE MEMORIES... </em> The happiest news is T-ARA girl group just came to Mongolia to perform in this September. Unfortunately, I am in Hawaii, right after school start. It is their second visit in Mongolia after around 10 years. The first time they come, hundreds of kids and teenagers were in Stadium. </p>
    <p>Now I likely listen to  <mark>"Aespa"</mark>. This band stand out their MV, it is always made like <strong>movie</strong>. I can&apos;t take my eyes off every minute clips. They are now going viral, but you know  nothing can beat &lt;Blackpink&gt;.</p>
    <p>Aespa has 4 members:</p> 
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Karina</li>
        <li>Winter</li>
        <li>Ning Ning ( my &quot;bias&quot;)</li>
        <li>Giselle</li>
    </ol>

    <p> &gt;&gt;This part of lyrics remind me to not underestimate myself and give my strength.</p>
