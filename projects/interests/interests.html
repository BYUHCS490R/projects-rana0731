        <h3 class="emphasize">"My Troublesome Star" k-drama</h3>
        <p class="deEmphasize">Recently, I watched a newest "My Troublesome Star" korean drama, which released on August 18, 2025. Most of the korean dramas have 16 episode. But this one only have 12 episode. And I just finished episodes. While I was watching 12th episode, I didn't even know it was the last. So sad but I was extremely happy that I watch my favorite actress Uhm Jung Hwa again after years.
        <p class="deEmphasize">Main casts are Uhm Jung-hwa as Im Sera / Bong Cheong-ja and Song Seung-heon as Dokgo Cheol. This drama is about an actress who has reached the peak of her career and is the youngest ever to win the Best Actress award, has an accident and wakes up 25 years later. She embarks on a hilarious adventure as she tries to regain her fame and glory. </p>
