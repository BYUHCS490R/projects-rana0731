        <p class="deEmphasize">South Korea's top actress Uhm Jung Hwa. She is known as Korean Diva. She is singer, actress and dancer. And she is very beautiful and big pretty eyes. When I watch her in movie, her eyes make the acting very believable. It's like he's hypnotized by her eyes. </p>
        <p class="deEmphasize">She is now 56 years old but look ten years younger. I watched her on "Dancing Queen" (2012), big hit Korean movie for the first time. And I really admired her talents, singing, dancing and her acting on that movie. After that I found out she is a singer. And I listened her all the songs, I was like WOW, I really love her. Then, I watched Television Shows which she participated, to know more about her, who she is exactly and her character. I loved more and I felt to become more like her, my role model.</p>
