            <h1 class="hometitle">K-POP</h1>
            <p class="hometext">K-pop (Korean: 케이팝; an abbreviation of "Korean popular music") is a form of popular music originating in South Korea. The music genre that the term is used to refer to colloquially emerged in the 1990s as a form of youth subculture, with Korean musicians taking influence from Western dance music, hip-hop, R&B and rock.Today, K-pop commonly refers to the musical output of teen idol acts, chiefly girl groups and boy bands, who emphasize visual appeal and performance. As a pop genre, K-pop is characterized by its melodic quality and cultural hybridity.</p>

            <h2 class="hometitle"> Global Impact </h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2012 when a song called “Gangnam Style” by South Korean solo artist PSY went viral. The digital era had come of age, and the song’s humorous video, featuring a tuxedo-clad PSY doing a dance reminiscent of riding a horse, was likely as responsible for the song’s worldwide popularity as its infectious techno-pop sound; the video was the first of any kind to get one billion views on YouTube, eventually surpassing three billion views. Through “Gangnam Style,” the world became aware that South Korea had modern catchy music to offer.
            </p>
            <p>The following year the K-pop industry unveiled what would become one of their most successful acts: BTS (initially known as Bangtan Sonyeondan, or “Bulletproof Boy Scouts,” and Bangtan Boys; in 2017 they began going by Beyond The Scene). The seven-member group distinguished themselves from other K-pop bands with songs not solely focused on romance but also on mental health, self-love, bullying, and their own stories of the pressures of fame.</p>
            <p>Blackpink has achieved major international fame. In 2020 the music video for their song “How You Like That” broke five Guinness World Records, including three previously held by BTS. A landmark year for Blackpink was 2022, with their album Born Pink debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart.</p>
